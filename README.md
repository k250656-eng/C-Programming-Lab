### Making a repository
This repository has been made for my PF Lab Task#3\
This assignment is due on ~~7 PM~~ **8 PM, Thursday**
I was instructed to;
- [x] Create a GitHub account (if not already created).
- [x] Create a new repository with the name C-Programming-Lab.
- [x] Add a README.md file and write a short description about the repository.

Listed above are the ***objectives.***\
*I experimented with Github during the online class, hence my account already has some repositories/ files present.*
